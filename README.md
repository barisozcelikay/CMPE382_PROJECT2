## Project-2 : Creating TEDU_alloc
### Kadir Kaan Yazgan - Barış Özçelikay


#### Work dividing and information:
Project Partners: Barış Özçelikay, Kadir Kaan Yazgan\

First, we did a separate research to decide with which algorithm we want to develop the project. Baris while researching about the first fitting algorithm, Kaan researched the best fit algorithm. After the researches, we decided that the first fitting logic would be more appropriate and we planned our code around this algorithm. After this stage, we developed our code by working jointly on the Discord program. Apart from that, we also used github. As a result, we cannot say that we have divided the homework into two because we both took part in every stage of the project.

#### Design overview:
Our goal in this project is to design our own memory allocation. There are mem.c, mem.h, mymain.c files in the project. We have also created a dynamic library called libmem.so. Because of this dynamic library we can added/loaded at runtime. We also created the Makefile file to run the project. With this file, we have made it possible to run multiple files (mem.c, mymain.c, mem.h) with a single command. To run this file, first you need type to shell "make".  Then you can run the project with the "./myprogram" command.
